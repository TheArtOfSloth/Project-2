Tarin here

Friday the 19th
11:00 am
the team is all up here working on stuff. I'm working on both the structure of our main function, and helping create menu.h. So far I've storyboarded the main function so we can keep our structure straight

12 noon
The team is wrapping up for the day, I've tweaked some more stuff in menu, created the userMenu as I call it
I want to make an exit function that can be called at any time rather than just relying on making the user use interrupts. Evan has suggested I use polling, put the entire main function into a loop

Sunday
7 PM
I had nothing better to do, so I looked up the rules of Rullo and put them in out userMenu in case the user needs instructions like I did

Monday
11 pm
After class today, our team decided on a quick little idea, one that would cost almost nothing and would make printing out instructions for the user much simpler: store the instructions in seperate text files, rather than a bunch of cout commands inside the program itself. So I typed those up, will implement later

Wednesday
12:30 PM
Wrote some pseudocode for the main menu. I want to get this thing done but for that I need to storyboard it to check for user functionality before code functionality
11:30 PM
Wrote a little more refined pseudocode

Friday
12 noon
I forgot to log this in last night; I was picking at my pseydocode. It turns out that the menu stuff we already wrote works perfectly so while the notes were good practice it's being scrapped.
Today we are making some default puzzle files for testing. I've already made a 5x5 one, let's move on to some bigger stuff to test our scaling
6 pm
I realized I completely screwed up one of the puzzles and rebuilt it

Monday
According to the emails before class and hte team meeting during class we're... done? Hopefully? Every other team member is announcing they've finished up, and it doesn't seem like I have any jobs to help them on. I guess we're submitting like this
