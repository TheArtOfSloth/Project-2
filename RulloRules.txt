Welcome! The instructions of Rullo are simple to learn, but can be quite the challenge to master.
You will be presented with a grid of numbers. Inside the play field are a set of numbers you can click on to turn "on" and "off".
Around the top and sides of the grid are lists of sums. A sum along the top, for example, is the "target" sum for the vertical column it touches. The same goes for the horizontal rows and the adjacent sum.
Your goal, is to turn the numbers in the grid such that all the numbers turned "on" in a column will add up to the target sum. At the same time you need to ensure the numbers turned "on" in a given row add up to that target sum. Once every sum, along the columns and along hte rows, has been met, you win the game!
