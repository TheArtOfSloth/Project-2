My job(s):

1) Work on menu with Tarin

2) write string-reading function for when the user makes a move.
-> IDEAS:
          -put in menu.h, function takes a string and reads it
          -if the sting is a standard move, pass the integers to the game object
          -if the string is "help" or "menu", run another function, "mid-menu"
          -mid-menu creates a temporary int variable, and uses a switch statement
              to determine what the user wants to do (i.e. exit program, new puzzle,
              new game type, get hint, etc...)
